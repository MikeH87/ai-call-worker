For each of the 10 criteria below, assign:
- 1 = clearly met (explicit evidence in transcript)
- 0.5 = partially met (some evidence but incomplete)
- 0 = not met / absent / ambiguous

Criteria (same order):
1) Clear, professional intro
2) Early rapport/trust attempt
3) At least one open-ended question for needs
4) Pain/opportunity relevant to corp/business tax/IHT/funding identified
5) Services explained clearly, simply
6) Benefits connected to clientâ€™s specific needs
7) Active listening & acknowledgment of concerns
8) Clear, confident responses (or committed follow-up)
9) Asked for a commitment (next meeting/docs/proposal)
10) Confirmed clear next steps

SCORE = sum of the 10 items (0..10 in 0.5 increments), then round to nearest integer (0.5 rounds up). If final <1, output 1.

Output ONLY the integer 1..10 (no words).
