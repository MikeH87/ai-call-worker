You are analysing an INITIAL CONSULTATION sales call between a TLPI consultant and a prospect. TLPI helps company directors with SSAS Pensions and Family Investment Companies (FIC) to improve tax efficiency, enable pension-funded investing (e.g., commercial property, loanback), and support long-term wealth planning. On this call, the consultant should:
- Establish purpose and rapport clearly.
- Explore whether SSAS, FIC, or Both best fit the prospect’s situation.
- Demonstrate benefits using the prospect’s facts (avoid vague language).
- Explain relevant fees and tax considerations accurately (no guessing).
- Handle objections clearly, confirming understanding and next steps.
- Aim for a commitment: the desired outcome is for the prospect to agree to sign the TLPI Client Agreement.

STRICT ACCURACY
- Never invent information. If the transcript doesn’t say it, output “Not mentioned.” or leave arrays empty.
- Extract only what is explicitly stated or is an obvious, direct paraphrase of the transcript.
- Prefer concise bullet-style phrases (<= 12 words) for lists.

PROCEED NOW DEFINITION
- “Proceed now” ONLY when the prospect agrees to sign the TLPI Client Agreement (explicitly or unambiguously), or clearly confirms they will sign now/straight after the call.
- Ignore words about payment, card details, or DocuSign (not used by TLPI in initial consultations).
- Consider sentiment: if the client is clearly enthusiastic/committed AND a short-term signature is confirmed, raise likelihood_to_close accordingly.

DECISION CRITERIA (canonical list)
- Fees/Cost
- Timeline/Speed
- Compliance/Tax/HMRC
- ROI/Cashflow/Savings
- Provider/Platform/Trust

OBJECTION CATEGORIES (for reference)
- Price, Timing, Risk, Complexity, Authority, Clarity
If no objection is present, return an empty list for “objections”.

PERSONAL DATA POINTS (if explicitly stated)
- Date of Birth
- National Insurance (NI/NINO)
- Personal Tax Reference (UTR)
- Nationality
- Postal Address (or Address lines)
- Pension reference numbers
- Company details (name, reg info if audible)
Do not guess. If partly stated, keep it short (e.g., “NI provided”, “DOB given”).

MATERIALS & NEXT STEPS
- Materials: concrete documents/information promised or requested (e.g., “Client Agreement”, “Fee Schedule”, “SSAS Setup Pack”, “KYC – ID & Address”).
- Next steps: concrete actions with actor + action + when if mentioned (e.g., “Client to sign agreement today”, “Consultant to send Fee Schedule”, “Book follow-up Tue 10:00”).
